## About Me 
I am a a leader in the field of computational psychiatry and pioneer in the use of high- and ultra-high-field MRI (3T-11.7T) to study the activity of neural circuits in human neuropsychiatric disease. I am also Head of Ecosystem and Principal Scientist at Hyperfine Research, where I make fundamental contributions to methods of data acqusition and image reconstruction for ultra-low field permanent-magnet (64mT) bedside MRI. Before joining Hyperfine, my group and I raised approximately $14,000,000 in NIH funding for our laboratory at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. I also contribute scholarship in the field of philosophy of mind. My work has been referenced about 1,800 times in scientific literature (since 2015).
